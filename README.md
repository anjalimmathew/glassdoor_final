Final scraper built with Scrapfly for collecting glassdoor data
- recommended to run on an external server, this program will take a while but is the most efficient way to use Scrapfly's tokens (which you have to pay for with an account)
sign up here: https://scrapfly.io/

INPUT: a spreadsheet with the Company Names, and respective glassdoor URLs to be scraped (there is a separate program to generate these online, or you can do it by hand) 
-> currently: "mini_firms.xlsx"
Output: 
- A sheet with the physical reviews
-> currently: "new_reviews.xlsx"
- A sheet detailing
